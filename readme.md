# Marzipan - A simple HTML5 game engine


## roadmap
* WebGL renderer (fully deprecating canvas rendering)
* Renderers as properties of scenes
* Get rid of EventDispatcher as a base class, and replace with EventChannels
* Proper build chain
* Input system like in Monocle?
	* To what extend does this make sense for touch/non input rebinding systems?
* Make barreling script into its own proper npm package
* Proper NPM moduling
